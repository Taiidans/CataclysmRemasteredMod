Description:

Welcome to Cataclysm Remastered! 

This mod is an in-progress community effort to bring HW Cataclysm into the new Remastered engine and the HWRM collection. 

Currently includes multiplayer / player vs CPU as Somtaaw, Beast or any vanilla race. Campaign levels coming soon! 

Add [code]-mpbeta[/code] in the command-line parameters in the mod page to enable multiplayer.

Most ship models are ported from the HWU HW2 mod, but some are modified HWRM models, or ported directly from Cataclysm. 
Weapons & FX are a mix of HWU & HWRM. 
Music / sounds are a direct port from Cataclysm. 

Thanks to LeviathansWrath, HWU team, and 23-Down for your help. 

v1.3: Rebuilt from the ground up designed for compatibility with the upcoming campaign mod.

Known bugs: 
-No Beast sounds yet
-No salvage points on capital ships. 
-Various balance issues 
-Kuun-lan top modules can be built even if top ore hold is built 
-Worker repairs / harvests only at close distances (Thanks to HW2/HWRM engine...) \
